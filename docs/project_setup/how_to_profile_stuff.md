# How to profile stuff.

Just read the fucking python docs there are very good. Look for cProfile and timeit.  
cProfile is for profiling a whole script, module or entire pieces of code. It gives you a callgraph and tells you how much time is spent in which function. timeit is for testing smaller pieces of code.

For visualization of cProfile you can use SnakeViz.
